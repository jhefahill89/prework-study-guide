# prework-study-guide
## Description

- My motivation for this project was to get a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- I built this project to help me build th foundations of how to begin my coding juorney, and to go back and look at where I begin, and by the end of the Bootcamp, This will show how far I have come since then.
- The problem solved here was to make sure I have a study guide that would help me at the begining of this bootcamp.
- I learned how to create style with CSS. How to use Git with some basic Git comands and navigate folders on my pc using comand lines. How to use HTML on a website. Also how to use Javascript to create funtion on my webiste, for loops, using else if, and etc.
